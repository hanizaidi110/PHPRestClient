"# PHPRestClient" 

A simple PHP client which uses CURL and the REST service (https://github.com/jethroo/WADL-first-REST-Webservice-CXF-Example) to make GET,PUT,POST and DELETE calls. 

Steps:
1) install maven
2) Goto REST service directory and run service from command line
3) Put restClient.php in local server directory (wamp-www in my case)
4) start local server
5) open localhost/restClient.php

Proxy: localhost
proxyport: 3128
